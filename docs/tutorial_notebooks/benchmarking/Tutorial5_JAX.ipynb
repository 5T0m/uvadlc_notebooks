    "In this tutorial, we will implement and discuss variants of modern CNN architectures. There have been many different architectures been proposed over the past few years. Some of the most impactful ones, and still relevant today, are the following: [GoogleNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)/Inception architecture (winner of ILSVRC 2014), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) (winner of ILSVRC 2015), and [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) (best paper award CVPR 2017). All of them were state-of-the-art models when being proposed, and the core ideas of these networks are the foundations for most current state-of-the-art architectures. Thus, it is important to understand these architectures in detail and learn how to implement them. \n",

    "## Trainer Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [PyTorch version](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html) of this tutorial, we would now introduce the framework [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) which simplifies the overall training of a model. So far (June 2022), there is no clear equivalent of it for JAX. Some basic training functionalities are implemented in `flax.training` ([documentation](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flax.training.html)), and predefined training modules are implemented in `trax` ([documentation](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), but neither provide a complete, flexible training package yet like PyTorch Lightning. Hence, we need to write our own small training loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we take inspiration from PyTorch Lightning and build a trainer module/object with the following main functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Storing model and parameters*: In order to train multiple models with different hyperparameters, the trainer module creates an instance of the model class, and keeps the parameters in the same class. This way, we can easily apply a model with its parameters on new inputs.\n",
    "2. *Initialization of model and training state*: During initialization of the trainer, we initialize the model parameters and a new train state, which includes the optimizer and possible learning rate schedulers.\n",
    "3. *Training, validation and test loops*: Similar to PyTorch Lightning, we implement simple training, validation and test loops, where subclasses of this trainer could overwrite the respective training, validation or test steps. Since in this tutorial, all models will have the same objective, i.e. classification on CIFAR10, we will pre-specify them in the trainer module below.\n",
    "4. *Logging, saving and loading of models*: To keep track of the training, we implement functionalities to log the training progress and save the best model on the validation set. Afterwards, this model can be loaded from the disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting to implement a trainer module with these functionalities, we need to take one prior step. The networks we will implement in this tutorial use BatchNormalization, which carries an exponential average of the prior batch statistics (mean and std) to apply during evaluation. In PyTorch, this is simply tracked by an object attribute of an object of the class `nn.BatchNorm2d`, but in JAX, we only work with functions. Hence, we need to take care of the batch statistics ourselves, similar to the parameters, and enter them during every forward pass. To simplify this a little, we overwrite the `train_state.TrainState` class of Flax by adding a field for the batch statistics:"

In general, we will mainly focus on the concept of Inception in this tutorial instead of the specifics of the GoogleNet, as based on Inception, there have been many follow-up works ([Inception-v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567), [Inception-v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567), [Inception-v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261), [Inception-ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261),...). The follow-up works mainly focus on increasing efficiency and enabling very deep Inception networks. However, for a fundamental understanding, it is sufficient to look at the original Inception block. \n",
    "\n",
    "An Inception block applies four convolution blocks separately on the same feature map: a 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolution, and a max pool operation. This allows the network to look at the same data with different receptive fields. Of course, learning only 5x5 convolution would be theoretically more powerful. However, this is not only more computation and memory heavy but also tends to overfit much easier. The overall inception block looks like below (figure credit - [Szegedy et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)):\n",

    "The additional 1x1 convolutions before the 3x3 and 5x5 convolutions are used for dimensionality reduction. This is especially crucial as the feature maps of all branches are merged afterward, and we don't want any explosion of feature size. As 5x5 convolutions are 25 times more expensive than 1x1 convolutions, we can save a lot of computation and parameters by reducing the dimensionality before the large convolutions.\n",

    "The GoogleNet architecture consists of stacking multiple Inception blocks with occasional max pooling to reduce the height and width of the feature maps. The original GoogleNet was designed for image sizes of ImageNet (224x224 pixels) and had almost 7 million parameters. As we train on CIFAR10 with image sizes of 32x32, we don't require such a heavy architecture, and instead, apply a reduced version. The number of channels for dimensionality reduction and output per filter (1x1, 3x3, 5x5, and max pooling) need to be manually specified and can be changed if interested. The general intuition is to have the most filters for the 3x3 convolutions, as they are powerful enough to take the context into account while requiring almost a third of the parameters of the 5x5 convolution.

    "## ResNet\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) paper is one of the  [most cited AI papers](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/google-scholar-reveals-most-influential-papers-research-citations-twenty-twenty), and has been the foundation for neural networks with more than 1,000 layers. Despite its simplicity, the idea of residual connections is highly effective as it supports stable gradient propagation through the network. Instead of modeling $x_{l+1}=F(x_{l})$, we model $x_{l+1}=x_{l}+F(x_{l})$ where $F$ is a non-linear mapping (usually a sequence of NN modules likes convolutions, activation functions, and normalizations). If we do backpropagation on such residual connections, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial x_{l+1}}{\\partial x_{l}} = \\mathbf{I} + \\frac{\\partial F(x_{l})}{\\partial x_{l}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias towards the identity matrix guarantees a stable gradient propagation being less effected by $F$ itself. There have been many variants of ResNet proposed, which mostly concern the function $F$, or operations applied on the sum. In this tutorial, we look at two of them: the original ResNet block, and the [Pre-Activation ResNet block](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027). We visually compare the blocks below (figure credit - [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"../../tutorial5/resnet_block.svg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"300px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The original ResNet block applies a non-linear activation function, usually ReLU, after the skip connection. In contrast, the pre-activation ResNet block applies the non-linearity at the beginning of $F$. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. For very deep network, however, the pre-activation ResNet has shown to perform better as the gradient flow is guaranteed to have the identity matrix as calculated above, and is not harmed by any non-linear activation applied to it. For comparison, in this notebook, we implement both ResNet types as shallow networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the original ResNet block. The visualization above already shows what layers are included in $F$. One special case we have to handle is when we want to reduce the image dimensions in terms of width and height. The basic ResNet block requires $F(x_{l})$ to be of the same shape as $x_{l}$. Thus, we need to change the dimensionality of $x_{l}$ as well before adding to $F(x_{l})$. The original implementation used an identity mapping with stride 2 and padded additional feature dimensions with 0. However, the more common implementation is to use a 1x1 convolution with stride 2 as it allows us to change the feature dimensionality while being efficient in parameter and computation cost. The code for the ResNet block is relatively simple, and shown below:"

    "Finally, we can train our ResNet models. One difference to the GoogleNet training is that we explicitly use SGD with Momentum as optimizer instead of Adam. Adam often leads to a slightly worse accuracy on plain, shallow ResNets. It is not 100% clear why Adam performs worse in this context, but one possible explanation is related to ResNet's loss surface. ResNet has been shown to produce smoother loss surfaces than networks without skip connection (see [Li et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09913.pdf) for details). A possible visualization of the loss surface with/out skip connections is below (figure credit - [Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09913.pdf)):\n",

    "The $x$ and $y$ axis shows a projection of the parameter space, and the $z$ axis shows the loss values achieved by different parameter values. On smooth surfaces like the one on the right, we might not require an adaptive learning rate as Adam provides. Instead, Adam can get stuck in local optima while SGD finds the wider minima that tend to generalize better.\n",
    "However, to answer this question in detail, we would need an extra tutorial because it is not easy to answer. For now, we conclude: for ResNet architectures, consider the optimizer to be an important hyperparameter, and try training with both Adam and SGD. Let's train the model below with SGD:"

    "## DenseNet\n",
    "\n",
    "[DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) is another architecture for enabling very deep neural networks and takes a slightly different perspective on residual connections. Instead of modeling the difference between layers, DenseNet considers residual connections as a possible way to reuse features across layers, removing any necessity to learn redundant feature maps. If we go deeper into the network, the model learns abstract features to recognize patterns. However, some complex patterns consist of a combination of abstract features (e.g. hand, face, etc.), and low-level features (e.g. edges, basic color, etc.). To find these low-level features in the deep layers, standard CNNs have to learn copy such feature maps, which wastes a lot of parameter complexity. DenseNet provides an efficient way of reusing features by having each convolution depends on all previous input features, but add only a small amount of filters to it. See the figure below for an illustration (figure credit - [Hu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993)):\n",

    "\n",
    "The last layer, called the transition layer, is responsible for reducing the dimensionality of the feature maps in height, width, and channel size. Although those technically break the identity backpropagation, there are only a few in a network so that it doesn't affect the gradient flow much. \n",
    "\n",
    "We split the implementation of the layers in DenseNet into three parts: a `DenseLayer`, and a `DenseBlock`, and a `TransitionLayer`. The module `DenseLayer` implements a single layer inside a dense block. It applies a 1x1 convolution for dimensionality reduction with a subsequential 3x3 convolution. The output channels are concatenated to the originals and returned. Note that we apply the Batch Normalization as the first layer of each block. This allows slightly different activations for the same features to different layers, depending on what is needed. Overall, we can implement it as follows:"
